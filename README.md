# SQA Undergraduate Research Scholarship Research Summary

In this research, I was tasked with determining the usage of quantum Monte
Carlo method found in [Ryan O'Donnell's
paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07544.pdf).

In the following sections I will go through a summary of the topics that I
explored, where I found uses, where I was stuck and any future paths that I
found.

## Financial Application

## Property Testing Algorithms

## Data Streaming Algorithms

## Randomized Algorithms

## Misc
